# MySQL and Sakilla Database

The Sakila sample database was designed as a replacement to the world sample database, also provided by Oracle. The Sakila sample database was initially developed by Mike Hillyer, a former member of the MySQL AB documentation team. I chose to use the Sakila database because it was intended to provide a standard schema that can be used for examples in books, tutorials, articles, samples, so forth and also serves to highlight the latest features and my knowledge of MySql.
